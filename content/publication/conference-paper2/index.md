abstract: Clinical note summarization is a challenging task that aims to extract the most relevant information from unstructured text documents and present it concisely and coherently. Large language models, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5, have limitations in terms of trustworthiness and cost-effectiveness for generating complete clinical notes from patient-doctor dialogues. In this paper, we propose a novel template-based approach of for clinical note summarization from dialogue. Our model is under the control of a specific template, which is constructed by our own team and relies on expert validation. The semantic-based partition module fills in the template with key facts extracted from the dialogue using a combination of rule-based and neural methods. The template-based summarization module fine-tunes state-of-the-art (SOTA) BART models and other strategies to generate fluent and informative summaries corresponding to parts in the template. We evaluated our approach on released datasets of MEDIQA-Sum 2023 Shared Tasks, which contain clinical notes from dialogue for various problems. Our approach achieves the best ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores for full note summarization, outperforming several strong baselines.
