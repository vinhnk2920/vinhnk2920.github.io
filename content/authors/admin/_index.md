## About Me

I'm Khanh-Vinh Nguyen (you can call me Vinh), a master's student and an NLP amateur. I'm pursuing my master's degree in Japan under the supervision of Shirai Kiyoaki sensei. My research now focuses on Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Summarization. In my free time, I travel and dance hip-hop. I'm finding PhD opportunity.
Thanks for visiting my site and have a nice day ü•∞.
<!-- During the summer of 2024, I visited Singapore to do a research internship at the Asian Institute of Digital Finance, NUS Singapore.
Previously, I was a teaching assistant at VNU University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam, and a research assistant at the data science and knowledge technology laboratory (FIT, VNU UET). From 2019, I worked as a software engineer for nearly 2 years at Giaohangtietkiem JSC. -->
