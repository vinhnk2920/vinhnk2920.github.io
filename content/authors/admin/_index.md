    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm Khanh-Vinh Nguyen (you can call me Vinh), a master's student and an NLP amateur. I'm pursuing my master's degree in Japan under the supervision of Shirai Kiyoaki sensei. My research now focuses on Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Summarization. In my free time, I travel and dance hip-hop. Thanks for visiting my site and have a nice day ü•∞.
<!-- During the summer of 2024, I visited Singapore to do a research internship at the Asian Institute of Digital Finance, NUS Singapore.
Previously, I was a teaching assistant at VNU University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam, and a research assistant at the data science and knowledge technology laboratory (FIT, VNU UET). From 2019, I worked as a software engineer for nearly 2 years at Giaohangtietkiem JSC. -->
